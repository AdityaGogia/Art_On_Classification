# Art_On_Classification
The SVM exhibited the lowest error rate
among the classifiers, however this was at the expense of a pricey
hyperparameter tuning procedure. Using TensorFlow, Neural Networks
with Keras we got the highest accuracy of about 98%, KNN also
performed almost as well with a very straightforward tuning process. The
Ensemble classifiers didn't much boostup the performance. Although
slightly behind this state of the art, the TensorFlow, KNN classifiers, and
SVM (RBF) provided here nonetheless perform admirably given their
individual computational complexity.
Doing Dimensionality reduction doesn't always give us the speed, and also
in some rare cases it will give a little boost to the performance. But Most
probably it basically speeds up the training with slight degrade in
performance due to loss of some signals.
